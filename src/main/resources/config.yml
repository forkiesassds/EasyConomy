# True if the binary mode should be used for storage.
# Binary mode provides lower filesize (24 bytes per player) than the normal mode (45 bytes per player or more)
# as well as faster saving (~1500ms rather than ~9000ms per million players) and loading (~1300ms rather than ~8500ms per million players) speeds.
# A downside is that it's harder to repair damage to the file as well as editing things. USE BACKUPS!
